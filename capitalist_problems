a) Determining the risk requires a lot of information that only big corporations can have.                     ---->people will not invest.
b) People with small capital have a bigger risk aversion because they will lose more if they lose money.   ----> if the ovn succeeded, people would have money, but it might still hold. Also, there is a chicken and egg problem.

c) People with more capital can invest in more companies than others with fewer capital. They will invest on higher capital density investments.  ---> capitalists will invest more anyway and be more competitive.

d) Certain investments require a big amount of initial capital ---> The ovn tries to remove information friction and allow people to crowdfund and crowdsource that sum. It can be done.
