Let's assume that we have 2 firms with fixed capital Fa and Fb and Va Vb cost per product. with t_a, t_b maximum uses of capital.
Qa Qb.

Then, assuming that they will sell all t_a. the cost per product is F_a/t_a + Va.

Now at what price will they sell their product? Let's use the supply and demand curves.

If both products are the same, then customers will always consume the product that is cheaper.

Then We will have 2 options. Either one sells most of products or the other. Lets assume that both get half of the volume.Because they have identical prices.
What will be the price with maximum profit.

When the price is above the cost.


a) (P-C)*Q/2   multiplied by the cost of time. We can use the demand curve to find the maximum. If C is varriable to volume, then this maximum can be different for the 2 companies.
b) (P-C)*(Qa-Qmb)    finding the maximum profit here as well.

this is the theoretical solution, but it is important that consumers know the product and that they trust the brand and quality of the product. This is indepedent of the demand curve, but could affect the cost of production if it varriable to the quantity and not a fixed rate.

Good marketing could determine the perception of the product and thus produce the correct maximization function.
